# Sheb-Teth

___Devourer of Souls___

Counter-Forensic RE Challenge for LayerOne 2017 CTF.

## Installation ##

To play with the x86 binary that was provided at the conference:

	git clone https://github.com/emptymonkey/Sheb-Teth.git
	cd Sheb-Teth
	base64 -d <Sheb-Teth.x86.b64 >Sheb-Teth
	chmod 755 Sheb-Teth

To build your own (defaulting to x64):

	git clone https://github.com/emptymonkey/Sheb-Teth.git
	cd Sheb-Teth
	make

## Solution ##

It goes without saying, but the source code is the solution. Don't look at it! Try to play the binary!! 

[@iximeow](https://twitter.com/iximeow) did [an excellent writeup on their solution](https://www.iximeow.net/ctfs/2017/layerone/writeup_sheb-teth.html) that I highly recommend reading when you are done.
