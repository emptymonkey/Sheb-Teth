## History
This was a challenge presented at the LayerOne 2017 CTF.

## Solution ##
It goes without saying, but the source code is the solution. Don't look at it! Try to play the binary!! 

[@iximeow](https://twitter.com/iximeow) did [an excellent writeup on their solution](https://www.iximeow.net/ctfs/2017/layerone/writeup_sheb-teth.html) that I highly recommend reading when you are done. As he points out in the writeup, flag_02 had a bug. That is fixed in this version, but it required a new approach. The writeup may give _some_ insight into the solution but it is a fundimentally different challenge now.
